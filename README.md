The AITS project is an academic issue tracking system built with Django for the backend and React for the frontend. It is designed to manage and track academic issues raised by students, handled by lecturers, and reviewed by academic registrars. The backend uses the Django REST Framework to provide APIs for authentication, issue management, and notifications, while the frontend uses React with Vite for fast development and a responsive user interface.

The system includes role-based access control, meaning different users (students, lecturers, registrars, and admins) see different dashboards and functionalities. Students can submit academic issues, lecturers can respond to those issues, and registrars have administrative controls such as managing users and viewing notifications.

The goal of the project is to streamline the issue resolution process within academic institutions, improve accountability, and enhance communication among stakeholders.
